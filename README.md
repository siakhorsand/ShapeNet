# ShapeNet - A Shape Recognition Model

## Overview
A machine-learning project that recognizes hand-drawn shapes (circle, square, triangle, hexagon, octagon) in real-time using a web interface. You can draw shapes on a canvas, and the model predicts what shape it is. More shapes will be added later on.
